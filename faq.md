# Frequently Asked Questions


## Information for presenters

### What materials can I find on the Data Management Skillbuilding Hub page?

You will find a series of resources that help users learn to better manage their data; each is focused on one stage of the data lifecycle. Each resource is comprised of supporting materials, such a set of slides with presenter notes, a one-page explanatory sheet, and a hands-on exercise. These materials are meant to be flexible, usable and adaptable for use in a range of contexts. For example, they can be used for personal education, in classroom settings, by librarians teaching data management workshops, and more.

### How did you decide what information to include in the Data Management Skillbuilding Hub?
The education resources were initially developed in 2011-2012 and were peer reviewed and revised in 2015. In 2016, the  resources were moved to an open git repository (GitHub) to increase community engagement around the materials, and also to build interest in shared maintenance and ongoing sustainability. The decisions and process are described more fully in the publication [Using Peer Review to Support Development of Community Resources for Research Data Management][MnmgtPub].

### How do I access and view the materials associated with each topic?

Each suite of materials can be accessed by clicking on its associated tile on the [Data Management Skillbuilding Hub Home page][website]. Please note that your browser needs to allow Javascript; additionally Firefox, Chrome, and Safari browsers should be up-to-date for better functionality.

### Can I add, edit or modify content within the Data Management Skillbuilding Hub page?

Yes. It is okay for you add new content, or to make changes to existing content and redistribute in ways that suit your needs, such as PowerPoint. We ask that you provide appropriate citation and attribution to DataONE.

### How should I cite this content?

Within each topic, a citation to the lessen is provided.

### How do I give a slide presentation?

Those materials containing slides are provided as HTML documents that you can view and present in your browser, with or without the annotated notes. Every slide deck can be opened or "cloned" (in GitHub language) by pressing "c". This will open the slides in a separate pop-up window. Your browser may prompt you to allow or reject this pop-up window. Presentation mode can be activated by pressing "p" while the slide window is open. This mode should open the "presentation view" on your screen, and the viewer mode on the screen for your audience. You can also press "f" for fullscreen.

You can change slides by pressing the left and right arrows, or by swiping left or right on a touch-enabled device.
