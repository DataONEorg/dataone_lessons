# Frequently Asked Questions


## Information for presenters

### What material can I find on the Community Education Resources page?

You will find a series of resources that contain best practices for better data management, broken down by topic. Each topic is comprised of three parts: a set of slides with presenter notes, a one-page explanatory sheet, and a hands-on exercise. These materials are meant to be flexible, usable and adaptable for use in a range of contexts. For example, they can be used for personal education, in classroom settings, by librarians teaching data management workshops, and more. 


### How do I access and view the materials associated with each topic?

You can access the materials by clicking on each individual topic tile on the Community Education Resources Home page [the website associated][website]. The slides are provided as HTML documents that you can view and present in your browser, with or without the annotated notes. Please note that your browser needs to allow Javascript, and that Firefox, Chrome, and Safari browsers should be up-to-date. 


### Can I edit or modify the existing content within the Community Education Resources page?

Yes. It is okay for you to make changes to the content and redistribute in ways that suit your needs, such as PowerPoint. We just ask that you provide appropriate citation and attribution to DataONE. 


### How do I give a presentation using these slides?

Every slide deck can be opened or "cloned," in Github speak by pressing `c`. This will open it in another
pop-up window. Your browser may prompt you to allow or reject this pop-up window. Presentation mode can be activated by pressing 'p' on the slides page. This mode should open the "presentation view" on your screen, and the viewer mode on the screen for your audience. You can also press `f` for fullscreen.

You can change slides by pressing the left and right arrows, or by swiping left
or right on a touch-enabled device.

### How should I cite this content?

Within each topic, a citation to the lessen is provided.
