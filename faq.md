# Frequently Asked Questions


## Information for presenters

### What material can I find on the Community Education Resources page?

You will find a series of resources that help users better manage their data, broken down by data life-cylce. Each resource is comprised of supporting materials, such a set of slides with presenter notes, a one-page explanatory sheet, and a hands-on exercise. These materials are meant to be flexible, usable and adaptable for use in a range of contexts. For example, they can be used for personal education, in classroom settings, by librarians teaching data management workshops, and more. 


### How do I access and view the materials associated with each topic?

Each suites of materials can be accessed by clicking on its associated tile on the [Community Education Resources Home page][website]. Please note that your browser needs to allow Javascript, and that Firefox, Chrome, and Safari browsers should be up-to-date. 

### Can I add, edit or modify content within the Community Education Resources page?

Yes. It is okay for you add new content, or to make changes to existing content and redistribute in ways that suit your needs, such as PowerPoint. We ask that you provide appropriate citation and attribution to DataONE. 

### How should I cite this content?

Within each topic, a citation to the lessen is provided.

### How do I give a presentation using materials with slides?

The slides are provided as HTML documents that you can view and present in your browser, with or without the annotated notes. Every slide deck can be opened or "cloned," in Github speak by pressing `c`. This will open it in another pop-up window. Your browser may prompt you to allow or reject this pop-up window. Presentation mode can be activated by pressing 'p' on the slides page. This mode should open the "presentation view" on your screen, and the viewer mode on the screen for your audience. You can also press `f` for fullscreen.

You can change slides by pressing the left and right arrows, or by swiping left or right on a touch-enabled device.
