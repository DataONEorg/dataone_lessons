First we will define quality assurance and quality control, and review definitions for other related terms including data contamination, and review the common types of errors in data. Then we will review some best practices that can be implemented before data collection, during data collection, and after data collection to ensure high-quality data.

Quality control and quality assurance should be implemented throughout the data life cycle, but here we focus on measures that can be taken during collection.  The “assure” step in the data life cycle closely ties in with QAQC measures.
