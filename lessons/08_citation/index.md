# The Data Life Cycle

---

# Definitions

## Data citation
* "The practice of providing a reference to data in the same way as researchers routinely provide a bibliographic reference to printed resources"<sup>1</sup>
* "A key practice underpinning the recognition of data as a primary research output rather than as a by-product of research"<sup>1</sup>

## Data author
* "Individual involved in research, education, or other activities that generate digital data that are subsequently deposited in a data collection"<sup>2</sup>

## Persistent identifier
* A unique web-compatible alphanumeric code that points to a resource (e.g., data set) that will be preserved for the long term (i.e., over several hardware and software generations)
* Should direct to latest available version of resource or to metadata which enables acquisition of desired version or format
