# The Data Life Cycle

???

The Data Life Cycle is a continuum of data development, manipulation, management, and storage stages.

# Definitions
**Data Citation:** 
  - “The practice of providing a reference to data in the same way as researchers routinely provide a bibliographic reference to printed resources.”
  - “A key practice underpinning the recognition of data as a primary research output rather than as a by-product of research.”
  
**Data Author:**
  - “Individual involved in research, education, or other activities that generate digital data that are subsequently deposited in a data collection”

# Definitions, continued
**Persistent Identifier:**
  - A unique web-compatible alphanumeric code that points to a resource (e.g., data set) that will be preserved for the long term (i.e., over several hardware and software generations)
  - Should direct to latest available version of resource or to metadata which enables acquisition of desired version or format

# Benefits of Data Citation

.one-half[
Short term: 
- Facilitates discovery of relationships between data and publications, making it easier to validate and build upon previous work
- Ensures that proper credit can be given when others use your work
- Facilitates impact assessments of datasets based on number of publications that cite them
- Helps researchers re-using data to find other ways the data has been used.
