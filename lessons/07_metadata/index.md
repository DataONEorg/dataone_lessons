# What is metadata?

.two-thirds[**Metadata is: Data ‘reporting’**

* **WHO** created the data?
* **WHAT** is the content of the data?
* **WHEN** were the data created?
* **WHERE** is it geographically?
* **HOW** were the data developed?
* **WHY** were the data developed?

Metadata is data about data. It describes the content, quality, condition, and other characteristics of a dataset.  

Metadata records answer questions such as:
	Why was the dataset created?
	What processes were used to create the dataset?
	What projection are the data in?
	When were the data last updated?
	Who created the data?
	What scale was used?
	What fields are in the table?
	What do the values in those fields mean?
	Who do I contact about getting more information about the data?
	How do I obtain a copy of the data?
	Do the data cost anything?
	Are there any limitations to the data?

Metadata is a valuable tool. Metadata records preserve the usefulness of data over time by detailing methods for data collection and dataset creation. Metadata greatly minimizes duplication of effort in the collection of expensive digital data and fosters the sharing of digital data resources.

# Metadata in Real Life

Metadata is all around...

Metadata is all around us. . .from Mp3 players, to nutrition labels, to library card catalogues.
For example, a card catalogue tell us more information than just the title of the book, they also tells the user:
		Who is the author?
		Who published the book?
		What subject area does the book fall in?
		And finally, where is it located in the library? 

Another example of metadata that we see in our daily lives is the nutrition and ingredient information on food labels.
Nutrition labels answer questions such as: 
		What ingredients were used?
		Who made the food?
		How many calories per serving?
		How many servings in the can?
		What percentage of daily vitamins are in each serving?
