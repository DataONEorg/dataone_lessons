# Lesson Topics

- Key Digital Preservation Concepts
- Backups: Things to Consider
- Data Preservation
- Recommended Practices

???
These slides will cover several topics that relate to data protection.

The first section discusses the differences between three concepts: data protection, backups, and archiving, which are typically associated with digital preservation.  The second section will address why data protection is important. This will be followed by a section on things to consider when handling back-ups and how to deal with issues you may encounter.  The fourth section briefly discusses what data preservation is and what you should consider when dealing with it.  The last section discusses the importance of data backup plans along with recommended practices.

# Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, the participant will be able to: 
- Define the differences between backups and archiving data
- Identify significant issues related to data backups
- Identify why backup plans are important and how they can fit into larger backup procedures
- Discuss what data preservation covers
- List several recommended practices

???
By the end of this presentation, you will be able to define the differences between data backups and archives, characterize issues that you might encounter during data backups, and lastly weâ€™ll discuss recommended practices as related to backup plans.
Archives are used to preserve data for historical record and are intended to protect data integrity in case of disaster.

Suggested quiz questions:
Q1: How is archiving data different from backing up data?
Suggested answer: Data backup should occur throughout a research project, and backup files are created for use in the case of loss or corruption of the current version of the data. Archiving is usually only done for final versions of a data file, and archives are created with long-term storage in mind. 

Q2: Please describe at least two reasons why a researcher would choose to create data backups.
Suggested answers: 1) Creation of data backups limits or prevents loss of data in the case of accidental deletions, natural disasters, software bugs or hardware failures. 2) Data backups can also save time, money, and productivity by making it easier to respond to requests for data, allowing straightforward reproduction of results of past procedures based on older files. 3) Keeping data backups can also limit liability in cases of lawsuits or inability to reproduce data results

Q3: List at least four issues that should be considered when designing a data backup policy or system.
Suggested answers: 1) existing data backup policies (i.e., policies adopted by the project, office, department, organizational, funding source); 2) how often backups should be created and whether they should be full or partial backups; 3) media for backing up files (e.g., external disk, server, data repository); 4) locations where backups will be stored (including which locations and how many different locations); 5) metadata and organization/labeling systems necessary to retrieve desired backups efficiently; 6) whether backups will be manual or automatic; 7) quality control/quality assurance measures to check backup success and integrity of stored backup files; 8) who will be responsible for backups and serve as the contact person for users who need to retrieve backup files; 9) how outdated data will be disposed of; 10) plan for long-term storage including how long to keep backup files and what happens to backups after the project has ended; 11) designating person responsible for managing policies/workflow of backups, 12) incorporating existing legal requirements for storage and access over time. 

Q4: What are some good practices to follow when naming files?  Suggested answers: use consistent file names, use numbers or letters for file versioning, use file names that are descriptive and concise, avoid/rename generic file names
