# Welcome to Community Education Resources for Data Management

This webpage is a central location for education materials focused on research data management. We invite all kinds of materials related to research data management education, so please consider [contributing][CONTRIB]. Examples include: tutorials, best practices, exercises, presentations, webinars, etc.

## Background of the Community Education Resources



The Education Modules were initially developed in 2011-2012, and went through a process of peer review and revision in 2015.
In 2016, the Working Group made the decision to move the Education Modules to an open git repository (GitHub) to increase
The Community Education Resources page was developed to create community engagement around the data management education, and in order to build interest in shared maintenance and ongoing sustainability. The decisions and process are described more fully here. [doi:10.7191/jeslib.2017.1114 ]

As of May 2018 the repository contains ten revised DataONE Education Modules to serve as an example of materials that may be added to the repository. These ten modules have been translated from PowerPoint format to a more easily updated format (Markdown) that you can view and use in your browser. Each Education Module contains a set of slides with annotations, as well as a hands on exercise, a one-page explanatory sheet, and occasionally data. These resources are intended to be flexible and updated by a range of users and audiences.

Are you willing to share, contribute, or update resources here? See our [contribution guidelines][CONTRIB].

## What types of materials are here?

The materials in this repository are meant to be flexible and intended for a broad range of users. While Education Modules are an example of one content type, others are welcome! The only guideline is that materials should be related to research data management education. Some examples are: tutorials, webinars, demos, presentations, exercises, best practices, and videos.

## Where to find the material?

Clicking on one of the image tiles will bring you to the resource page, where you can browse or launch the materials for that module. For Education Modules, these may include a presentation, a PDF download of slides, a handout, and/or exercises. Slides may be launched from the resource page using the instructions there. PowerPoint slides, handouts, and exercises may also be downloaded from each resource page. For other resource types, you should be able to access and browse the available materials.


## Guidelines for content editors

We are glad that you want to take part in this community and contribute to the materials! You will find more information in our [contribution guidelines][CONTRIB].

<!--
In support of the DataONE project, the Community Engagement and Outreach Working group has developed a collection of research data management education resources. A central component of these resources was the creation of education modules that contain three complementary parts: slides, handouts, and exercises. These were designed for research data management training and to be adaptable for use in classroom teaching.
