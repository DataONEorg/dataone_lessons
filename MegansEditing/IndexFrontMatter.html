What is DataONE?

With just one easy search, DataONE provides access to Earth and environmental data across a network of data providers. 

DataONE has high quality resources for helping educators and librarians with training in data management, including teaching materials, webinars and a database of best-practices to improve methods for data sharing and management. 

What are these resources?

This GitHub page contains DataONE's Education Modules. The Modules are valuable resources for researchers, teachers, librarians, or anyone who needs to learn more data management. Each module contains a lesson in slide format with annotations, a one page handout that distills the main points and lessons to take away, and a supporting hands-on exercise.

The Education Modules are intended to be flexible and updated by a range of users and audiences. Please let us know what you think! 

Clicking on each lesson will bring you to the lesson page, where you can launch the presentation, download a PDF, or see the handout and exercises.
