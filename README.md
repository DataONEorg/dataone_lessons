# Welcome to the DataONE Data Management Education Module Repo!

This repository contains DataONE Education modules that have been updated and translated from PowerPoint format to a more easily updated, markdown format.

## Guidelines for presenters

### Where to find the material?

A list of the lessons can be found on [the website associated][website] to this
repository. The first page will present you with a list of the available lessons, and
clicking on each lesson will launch the presentations.

### What material is included?

Each of the DataONE Education Modules is comprised of three parts: a set of slides with presenter notes, a one-page explanatory sheet, and a hands-on exercise. These materials are meant to be flexible. They are usable and adaptable for use in a range of contexts-- for personal education, in classroom settings, by librarians teaching data management workshops, and more. 

### How does this work?

The slides are provided as html documents that you can view and present in your browser. Everything should work in reasonably recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Please note that your browser needs to allow Javascript.

### Presentation mode

Every slide deck can be opened or "cloned," in Github speak by pressing `c`. This will open it in another
pop-up window. Your browser may prompt you to allow or reject this pop-up window. Presentation mode can be activated by pressing 'p' on the slides page. This mode should open the "presentation view" on your screen, and the viewer mode on the screen for your audience. You can also press `f` for fullscreen.

You can change slides by pressing the left and right arrows, or by swiping left
or right on a touch-enabled device.
